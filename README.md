### Beginner Developers

Don't worry a lot of developers start out coding their first projects as a Discord bot (I did ðŸ˜‰) and it is not so easy to do so. Discordeno is built considering all the issues with pre-existing libraries and issues that I had when I first started out coding bots. 
If you are a beginner developer, you may check out these awesome official and unofficial boilerplates:

- [Official Discordeno Boilerplate](https://github.com/Skillz4Killz/Discordeno-bot-template)
- [Dencord Starter](https://github.com/ayntee/dencord-starter)
- [Add your Own]

If you do not wish to use a boilerplate, you may continue reading.

### Advanced Developers

Here's a minimal example to get started with:

```typescript
import startBot, { sendMessage, Intents } from "https://deno.land/x/discordeno@9.4.0/mod.ts";

startBot({
  token: "BOT TOKEN",
  intents: [Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES, Intents.GUILDS],
  eventHandlers: {
    ready: () => console.log('Successfully connected to gateway'),
    messageCreate: (message) => {
      if (message.content === "hello") {
        sendMessage(message.channelID, "Hi there!");
      }
    },
  },
});
```
