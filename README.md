## Beginner Developers

Don't worry a lot of developers start out coding their first projects as a Discord bot(I did ðŸ˜‰) and it is not so easy. With Discordeno, I tried to build it in a way that solved all the headaches I had when first starting out coding bots. If you are a beginner developer, please use a boilerplate: The official one is at: [GitHub](https://github.com/Skillz4Killz/Discordeno-bot-template) but there will be more listed on the website. It is a beautiful website indeed! Check it out!

**Modular commands, arguments, events, inhibitors, monitors, tasks.**

**Step By Step Guide**
  - There is a step by step walkthrough to learn how to create Discord bots with Discordeno on our website!

## Advanced Developers
The instructions below are meant for advanced developers!

Starting with Discordeno is very simple, you can start from scratch without any boilerplates/frameworks: Add this snippet of code into a new TypeScript file:

```typescript
import Client from "https://x.nest.land/Discordeno@8.4.1/src/module/client.ts";
import { sendMessage } from "https://x.nest.land/Discordeno@8.4.1/src/handlers/channel.ts";
import { Intents } from "https://x.nest.land/Discordeno@8.4.1/src/types/options.ts";
import config from "./config.ts";

Client({
    token: config.token,
    intents: [Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES, Intents.GUILDS],
    eventHandlers: {
        ready: () => {
            console.log(`Logged!`);
        },
        messageCreate: (message) => {
            if (message.content === "!ping") {
                sendMessage(message.channelID, "Pong");
            }
        }
    }
});
```

Alternatively, you can use boilerplate template repositories that were created by wonderful developers. Review the list on the website, and add any of yours if you make your own.
