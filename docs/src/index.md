features:
- title: Functional API
  details: Has a neat and clean functional API, while removing the headaches of extending built-in classes, and inheritance. Avoid potential memory leaks, bot crashes, so on...
- title: Secure and convenient
  details: Discordeno internally checks for all missing permissions necessary before sending a request to the Discord API so that you do not get globally banned by Discord. Discordeno does not support self-bot functionality like most other libraries.
- title: Activity maintained & stable
  details: One of the biggest issues with almost every library is that they are not stable. Discordeno is actively being maintained; some of the other libraries maintainers have quit or no longer actively maintain it.
