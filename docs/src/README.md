## Features

- **Secure & stable**: Discordeno is secure and stable. One of the greatest
  issues with almost every library is stability; types are outdated, less (or
  minimal) parity with the API, core maintainers have quit or no longer actively
  maintain the library, and whatnot. Discordeno, on the other hand, is actively
  maintained to ensure great performance and convenience. Moreover, it
  internally checks all missing permissions before forwarding a request to the
  Discord API so that the client does not get globally-banned by Discord.
- **Simple, Efficient, & Lightweight**: Discordeno is simplistic, easy-to-use,
  versatile while being efficient and lightweight. Follows
  [Convention Over Configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)
  design paradigm â€• prefers defaults options or values that are recommended by
  Discord or the best configuration for the majority of the users.
- [**Functional API**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming):
  Functional API ensures an overall concise yet performant code while removing
  the difficulties of extending built-in classes and inheritance.

## Read me first...

Discordeno is cool right? You could make the next big bot! Who knows, but before
we get right into developing our Bot. We want to get started with learning the
basics...

You've seen how amazing Discord Bots are built and functioned! So beginning with
Discordeno always starts with learning the TypeScript and/or JavaScript
programming languages first. Making a Discord bot with very little knowledge is
possible, it can be a challenge! You may end up dealing with Console errors or
just syntax typographical errors...

If you are new to Discordeno, TypeScript or JavaScript, here are some great
resources:

- [Official TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html)
- [JavaScript Documentation from Devdocs](https://devdocs.io/javascript/)
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
- [TypeScript Deep Dive](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/)

There are always more resources... Take your time and don't fret! Come back when
you are ready, we can't wait to see what your Discordeno created bot does!
