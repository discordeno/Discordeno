## Features

- **Secure & stable**: Discordeno is comparatively more stable than the other
  libraries. One of the greatest issues with almost every library is stability;
  types are outdated, less (or minimal) parity with the API, core maintainers
  have quit or no longer actively maintain the library, and whatnot. Discordeno,
  on the other hand, is actively maintained to ensure great performance and
  convenience. Discordeno internally checks all missing permissions before
  forwarding a request to the API so that the client does not get
  globally-banned by Discord.
- **Efficient & lightweight**: Discordeno is simplistic, easy-to-use, versatile,
  and efficient. Uses
  [Convention Over Configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)
  design paradigm â€• prefers defaults that Discord recommends or the best
  configuration for the majority of the users.
- [**Functional API**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming):
  This will produce an overall concise and more performant code while removing
  the difficulties of extending built-in classes and inheritance.

## Read me first...

Discordeno is cool right? You could make the next big bot! Who knows, but before
we get right into developing our Bot. We want to get started with learning the
basics...

You've seen how amazing Discord Bots are built and functioned! So beginning with
Discordeno always starts with learning the TypeScript and/or JavaScript
programming languages first. Making a Discord bot with very little knowledge is
possible, it can be a challenge! You may end up dealing with Console errors or
just syntax typographical errors...

If you are new to Discordeno, TypeScript or JavaScript, here are some great
resources:

- [Official TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html)
- [JavaScript Documentation from Devdocs](https://devdocs.io/javascript/)
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
- [TypeScript Deep Dive](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/)

There is always more resources... Take your time and don't fret! Come back when
you are ready, we can't wait to see what your Discordeno created bot does!
