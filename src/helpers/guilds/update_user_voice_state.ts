 * Updates another user's voice state.

 *  - `channel_id` must currently point to a stage channel.
 *  - User must already have joined `channel_id`.
 *  - You must have the `MUTE_MEMBERS` permission. (Since suppression is the only thing that is available currently.)
 *  - When unsuppressed, non-bot users will have their `request_to_speak_timestamp` set to the current time. Bot users will not.
 *  - When suppressed, the user will have their `request_to_speak_timestamp` removed.
